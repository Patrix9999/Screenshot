# Introduction

This Gothic plugin adds the ability to create and save screenshots into `Game/Screens/` subfolder.  
It works for every Gothic game, you can use it to create awesome screenshots for our beloved game.

This project is a union plugin that restores the cut feature that was present in **Gothic 1** and **Gothic Sequel** into **Gothic 2** and **Gothic 2 Night of The Raven**, that allows light vobs range to be animated and interpolated by scaling factors.  
Keep in mind that altough original spacer does has options for setting up the animation, it won't show it, because the spacer.exe binary isn't 100% compatible with game binary.  
That means, that the only way to use and see this feature, is by using **Spacer.NET**, that supports it well (because it operates on the original game).

# Settings

The plugin can be configured by changing settings in `Screenshot.ini` file.  
This file is automatically generated if it's not present near `Screenshot.dll`.

Below you can find the default configuration with option descriptions:

```ini
[Settings]
sfx=screenshot2.wav		; Sound that is being played when you press PrintScreen key, can be set to empty text for no sound
file_type=jpg			; Produced screenshot file type, supported types are: jpg, png, bmp
jpg_quality=95			; JPG quality, set this value in range <0, 100>
border_fix=1			; Enable border fix for fullscreen game? Useful for ppl that are playing on System Pack
```
